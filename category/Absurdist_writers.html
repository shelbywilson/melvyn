Absurdist fiction is a reaction against the surge in Romanticism in Paris in the 1830s, the collapse of religious tradition in Germany, and the societal and philosophical revolution led by the expressions of SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche.Common elements in absurdist fiction include satire, dark humor, incongruity, the abasement of reason, and controversy regarding the philosophical condition of being "nothing".</p></div><p>3 episodes</p><p style="margin-bottom: -1rem">Episodes in this category also belong to the following categories:</p><div class="categories"><a
