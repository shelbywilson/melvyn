This century of enormous economic, social, intellectual and political transformation produced two important literary and philosophical movements:  during what became known as the Age of Enlightenment, the Philosophes  questioned all existing institutions, including the church and state, and applied rationalism and scientific analysis to society; and a very different movement, which emerged in reaction to the first movement; the beginnings of Romanticism, which exalted the role of emotion in art and life.</p></div><p>3 episodes</p><p style="margin-bottom: -1rem">Episodes in this category
