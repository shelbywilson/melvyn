It gained full flowering in the early 18th century, building on ideas stemming at least as far back as the 13th century within the Iberian, Anglo-Saxon, and central European contexts and was foundational to the American Revolution and "American Project" more broadly.Notable liberal individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include John Locke, Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo.</p></div><p>4 episodes</p><ol><li><div><h3 class="">David Ricardo</h3><div class="episode-content"><div class="content-col"><p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Ricardo's
