<h1>Gay academics</h1>
<div class="category-summary"><p>The Gay Academic Union (GAU) was a group of LGBT academics who aimed at making the academia more amenable to the LGBT community in the United States. It was formed in April 1973, just four years after the Stonewall riots, held 4 yearly conferences (the last in November, 1976) and conducted other scholarly activities.</p>
