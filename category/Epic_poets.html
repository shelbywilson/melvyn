== Etymology ==
The English word epic comes from the Latin epicus, which itself comes from the Ancient Greek adjective ἐπικός (epikos), from ἔπος (epos),
"word, story, poem."In ancient Greek, 'epic' could refer to all poetry in dactylic hexameter (epea), which included not only Homer but also the wisdom poetry of Hesiod, the utterances of the Delphic oracle, and the strange theological verses attributed to Orpheus.</p></div><p>5 episodes</p><ol><li><div><h3 class="">Goethe</h3><div class="episode-content"><div class="content-col"><p>Melvyn Bragg
